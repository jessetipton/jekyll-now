I would say–all things considered–my experience of this class has absolutely been a net positive. Despite much stress induced by the IDB project, I learned a lot and benefited from the experience of working on a team. Using collaboration tools to keep our team productive, coordinating tasks and responsibilities, and meeting deadlines are all valuable things to have exposure to before graduating.

My gripes with the course are likely shared by everyone. For example, frustration with GCP. These are only implementation details and do not detract substantially from the value the course offers.

I would (and do) recommend this class to anyone trying to select an upper-division Computer Science course.
