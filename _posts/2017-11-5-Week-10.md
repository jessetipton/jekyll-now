# What did you do this past week?

Last week I took my Compilers midterm on Halloween, which made the experience extra spooky. I got quite a few grades back last week and am pleased to report they were all fine. On Friday, I drove over to College Station to visit my family for the weekend. It was very troubling to learn that [one of the songs sung at A&M football games is about sawing the horns off of a longhorn](http://www.metrolyrics.com/the-aggie-war-hymn-lyrics-texas-am.html).

# What's in your way?

I’m still struggling with time management day-to-day. There’s never really a moment in the day during which there isn’t something I should be working on.

# What will you do next week?

This week I will focus on my portion of IDB3 and my part-time work. I was responsible for adapting [eero’s app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/eero-home-wifi-system/id1023499075?ls=1&mt=8) for the iPhone X screen. So far it seems like [people are receiving the update well](https://www.reddit.com/r/eero/comments/7ajp1w/everything_is_looking_good_on_iphone_x/?st=J9M9A0QD&sh=b42792d6).

# What's my experience of the class?

My group has not made much progress on IDB3, which is slightly troubling. The pattern we’ve (unintentionally) adopted is that each team member is specialized in a specific layer of our stack. I’m not sure if that is the best way to work, but I don’t exactly see us breaking that mold in the remaining phases of the project.

# What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

My pick-of-the-week is the [iPhone X](https://apple.com/iphone-x). I received mine this past Friday and it is **not bad**.
